About Me: This is in relation to my Computability and Complexity final project of Winter 2021. I was tasked to create an application in order to determine if a binary string is decidable. The code consists of 2 parts:
  1) Contructing the DFA - A user can input all of the information it needs in order to test the string. The application with prompt the user to state: # of nodes in the DFA, establish the relationships with other nodes, establish start and final node. 
  2) Feed the DFA a binary string - After the DFA has been constructed, a user can run different binary strings to test on the newly constructed DFA. The function will return a message that the DFA either ACCEPTS the string or REJECTS it. 

Instructions:
1) Download the DFA folder and run python on main.py. All of the functions are in utils.py so it is imperative that they are in the same folder.
2) You can test your own strings by opening up the main.py and scroll all the way to the bottom. You will find commented out variables to that you can uncomment out and test your own strings. 
**NOTE** you must import the termcolor library for the program to run. I use color text to make the program easier to read.
